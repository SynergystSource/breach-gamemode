# Breach Gamemode
## Made by Kanade

I've tried to contact Kanade about open-sourcing before, but so far the only thing I've heard is from someone who asked him about it a week ago who said he would do it but he didn't know how, so I went ahead and set up the github repository for him.

**Kanade, go make a github account at the following link and I'll make you the owner of the organization the repo is under, so you get control over incoming PRs and issues.**
